From someone who started in Macquarie as a freshman, he displayed his willingness to learn the new technologies and implement them successfully. He showed glimpsed of leadership skills by being responsible and accountable on the modules and tasks that he is doing and coordinate \n with the project team to resolve the issues and roadblocks. \nAs a testament to his willingness to learn, he was sent to Sydney Australia to have a hands on job training on UI/UX development. It will be a great experience and opportunity for him since he will surely be one of those people who will spearhead the UI/UX capability in Manila. \nIn terms of work relationship, I see Ryan as someone who gets a long with everybody on the team and a natural team player. He knows how to coordinate with people around him and also understands that there is a silver lining between friendship and professionalism. \nOverall as a fresh graduate entry, Ryan has displayed great technical skills and given his young experience, he has displayed glimpse of leadership skills. A lethal combination if he continuously improve on it.'
